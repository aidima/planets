    "**1) What trends are there in the mass vs distance figure?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two distinct groups, one for the rocky planets and one for the gas giants. The mass of a planet in general increases with distance from the sun.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Which planet is similar to the Earth?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Venus is the most similar having roughly the same mass and radius (it's a bit smaller).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Are the planets grouped similarly to the last plot of mass vs average distance?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes! Radius and Mass are related via density which is plotted in the third to last figure. Within the two planetary groups the densities are similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4) Why are the density of the gas gaints lower?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The gas giants are made up of mainly gases (hydrogen and helium) where the rocky planets are mainly made from rocks/silicate material with heavy iron cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5) Why is the density of Saturn lower than Jupiter?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupiter is bigger and hence it has a stronger gravitational field to compact the material it's made from so it has a higher density. You will see in the Planetary Interiors notebook that Jupiter has a much larger layer of highly compressed 'metallic' hydrogen inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6) Does Mercury look out of place in this plot?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes it does not follow the same trendline as the other rocky planets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7) What do you think the dashed line is?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This trendline is for planets that are like Earth, Mars, and Venus which have similar interiors and compositions. You will see why Mercury deviates from this line in the Planetary Interiors notebook when you plot the size of its layers against the other rocky planets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8) What differences are there between the exoplanets detected by Kepler using the 'Transit' vs the 'Imaging' method?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Detecting exoplanets is hard! The imaging method is where we have directly photographed the exoplanet. This favours very high mass Jupiter like planets which are far away from the host star. The transit method, where a dip in the light recieved by the host star is detected when the planet passes across the face of the star, favours larger and heavier planets which are very close to the host star. These are observational biases. It does not mean there are few Earth sized planets at roughly the same distance from their host star as the Earth, just that our current methods are biased towards finding much bigger planets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9) Again what differences are there between the exoplanets found by the four different methods?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The different methods are biased towards different sizes and masses of exoplanets at different distances. \n",

    "**10) Are we finding many Earth-like exoplanets?**\n",
